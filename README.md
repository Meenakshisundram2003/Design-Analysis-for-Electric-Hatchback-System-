# Design-Analysis-for-Electric-Hatchback-System-
Designed double wishbone suspension system for electric hatchbacks by leveraging concepts of Finite element analysis(FEA) to simulate load distribution and accurately predict stress points. Incorporated principles of material mechanics to select materials that can withstand dynamic forces and ensured dimensioning of crucial components like wishbone, spring, bolt, bracket and the calculations have been attached.Performed simulation in ANSYS Workbench to conduct comprehensive stress analysis to ensure the design criteria
