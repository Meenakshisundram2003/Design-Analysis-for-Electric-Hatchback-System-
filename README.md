# Design Analysis for Electric Hatchback System

## Overview
Designed a double wishbone suspension system for electric hatchbacks by leveraging concepts of Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to simulate load distribution and accurately predict stress points. Incorporated principles of material mechanics to select materials that can withstand dynamic forces, ensuring the proper dimensioning of crucial components like the wishbone, spring, bolt, and bracket.

## Features & Tools
* **CAD Modeling:** 3D models generated using Autodesk INVENTOR and Fusion 360.
* **Stress Analysis:** Performed simulations in ANSYS Workbench to conduct comprehensive stress analysis and ensure design criteria are met.
* **Documentation:** Attached calculations detailing the dimensioning of the suspension components.
