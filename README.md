# Design Analysis for Electric Hatchback System

## Overview
A mechanical engineering project detailing the design of a double wishbone suspension system for electric hatchbacks. By leveraging Finite Element Analysis (FEA), this project simulates load distribution and accurately predicts stress points. It incorporates principles of material mechanics to select materials capable of withstanding dynamic forces, ensuring proper dimensioning of crucial components.

## Features
* **Suspension Design:** Comprehensive dimensioning and design of a double wishbone suspension system, including the wishbone, spring, bolt, and bracket.
* **CAD Modeling:** 3D models generated using Autodesk INVENTOR and Fusion 360.
* **FEA Simulation:** Conducted comprehensive stress analysis using ANSYS Workbench to evaluate deformation, compressive forces, and tensile forces.
* **Calculation Documentation:** Includes attached spreadsheets and documents detailing the mathematical dimensioning of the suspension components.
